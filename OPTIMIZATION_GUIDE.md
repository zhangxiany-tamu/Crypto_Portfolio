### Step 2: Configure Your Analysis
1. **Select Cryptocurrencies**: Choose 2-8 assets from the dropdown
2. **Set Time Window**: Define start and end dates for historical analysis
3. **Choose Optimization Method**: Select from 4 available methods

### Step 3: Optimization Settings
1. **Risk Tolerance**: Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive
2. **Max Single Asset Weight**: Limit concentration risk (default 40%)
3. **Rebalancing Frequency**: How often to rebalance the portfolio

### Step 4: Generate Optimized Portfolio
1. Click **"üöÄ Optimize Portfolio"** button
2. Wait for calculations to complete
3. Review the results and download if desired

## üìä Optimization Methods Explained

### üöÄ Maximum Sharpe Ratio
- **What it does**: Finds the portfolio with the highest risk-adjusted return
- **Best for**: Investors seeking the best return per unit of risk
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Maximizes (Return - Risk-free rate) / Volatility
  - Often concentrates in assets with best risk-adjusted performance
  - Balances high returns with manageable risk

### ‚öñÔ∏è Mean-Variance Optimization
- **What it does**: Classic Markowitz optimization balancing expected returns vs risk
- **Best for**: Traditional portfolio construction with clear return targets
- **Characteristics**:
  - Considers both expected returns and portfolio variance
  - Respects risk tolerance constraints
  - Produces portfolios on the efficient frontier

### üõ°Ô∏è Minimum Variance
- **What it does**: Creates the lowest-risk portfolio possible
- **Best for**: Risk-averse investors prioritizing capital preservation
- **Characteristics**:
  - Ignores expected returns, focuses purely on risk reduction
  - Tends to favor assets with low volatility and negative correlations
  - Suitable for defensive strategies

### ‚ö° Risk Parity
- **What it does**: Allocates capital so each asset contributes equally to portfolio risk
- **Best for**: Diversification-focused strategies
- **Characteristics**:
  - Prevents any single asset from dominating portfolio risk
  - Creates more balanced allocations
  - Good for long-term strategic portfolios

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Risk Tolerance Levels

| Risk Level | Target Return | Max Volatility | Max Single Weight |
|------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | 8% | 20% | 30% |
| Moderate | 15% | 30% | 40% |
| Aggressive | 25% | 50% | 60% |

### Portfolio Constraints
- **Max Single Asset Weight**: Prevents over-concentration in any one asset
- **Long-only**: No short selling (weights ‚â• 0)
- **Fully Invested**: Weights sum to 100%

## üìà Understanding the Results

### Key Metrics Displayed

1. **Expected Return**: Annualized portfolio return based on historical data
2. **Volatility**: Annualized portfolio standard deviation
3. **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return measure (higher is better)
4. **Max Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline

### Portfolio Allocation
- **Weight Table**: Shows exact allocation percentages
- **Pie Chart**: Visual representation of portfolio composition
- **Performance Chart**: Compares optimized portfolio vs benchmarks

### Benchmarks
- **Equal Weight**: Simple 1/N allocation across selected assets
- **BTC Hold**: Bitcoin buy-and-hold strategy
- **Individual Assets**: Performance of each asset alone

## üí° Practical Usage Tips

### Choosing the Right Method

**For Maximum Returns**: Use **Maximum Sharpe Ratio**
- Best when you want the highest risk-adjusted returns
- Good for growth-oriented portfolios

**For Risk Management**: Use **Minimum Variance**
- Best when capital preservation is the priority
- Good during uncertain market conditions

**For Balanced Exposure**: Use **Risk Parity**
- Best when you want diversified risk exposure
- Good for long-term strategic allocation

**For Classic Optimization**: Use **Mean-Variance**
- Best when you have specific return targets
- Good for traditional portfolio management

### Time Window Selection
- **Shorter periods (3-6 months)**: More reactive to recent market conditions
- **Longer periods (1-2 years)**: More stable, long-term focused optimization
- **Recommendation**: Use 12 months for balanced results

### Asset Selection
- **Minimum**: 2 assets (required for optimization)
- **Recommended**: 4-6 assets for good diversification
- **Maximum**: 8+ assets (diminishing returns beyond this)

## üîÑ Workflow Example

### Scenario: Building a Moderate Risk Crypto Portfolio

1. **Setup**:
   - Select: BTC-USD, ETH-USD, BNB-USD, ADA-USD, SOL-USD
   - Time window: Last 12 months
   - Risk tolerance: Moderate

2. **Compare Methods**:
   - Run Maximum Sharpe Ratio optimization
   - Run Risk Parity optimization
   - Compare results and Sharpe ratios

3. **Choose Best Portfolio**:
   - Select the method with highest Sharpe ratio
   - Verify allocation makes sense (no extreme concentrations)
   - Check max drawdown is acceptable

4. **Implement**:
   - Download portfolio weights as CSV
   - Use in "Custom Backtest" mode to verify performance
   - Set up rebalancing schedule

---

## üìä Integration with Backtesting

### Using Optimized Weights in Backtesting
1. After optimization, switch to **"üìà Custom Backtest"** mode
2. Click **"üìä Use Optimized Weights"** to load your portfolio
3. Adjust initial capital and trading fees
4. Run backtest to see historical performance

### Performance Validation
- Compare optimized portfolio vs benchmarks
- Check risk metrics (volatility, drawdown)
- Verify results align with investment objectives

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers

### Limitations
- **Historical Data**: Optimization based on past performance
- **Market Conditions**: Future markets may behave differently
- **Simulation**: Uses simulated data for demonstration
- **No Guarantees**: Past performance doesn't predict future results

### Best Practices
- **Diversify**: Don't put all assets in one basket
- **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust portfolios
- **Monitor**: Track performance vs benchmarks
- **Educate**: Understand the risks before investing
