## Technical Details

### Data Sources & Reliability
- **Primary**: Yahoo Finance (yfinance) - Most reliable for historical data
- **Secondary**: CoinGecko API - Real-time price data backup
- **Tertiary**: Binance API - High-frequency data source
- **Fallback**: Cached data and error handling for robust operation

### Optimization Algorithms

#### 1. Mean-Variance Optimization
- Maximizes expected return for given risk level
- Uses CVXPY for convex optimization
- Constraints: long-only positions, maximum asset weights

#### 2. Risk Parity
- Equal risk contribution from all assets
- Minimizes portfolio concentration risk
- Ideal for diversification-focused strategies

#### 3. Black-Litterman
- Bayesian approach with market equilibrium baseline
- Incorporates investor views and confidence levels
- More stable than pure mean-variance optimization

#### 4. Maximum Sharpe Ratio
- Optimizes risk-adjusted returns
- Maximizes excess return per unit of risk
- Popular for risk-conscious investors

### Enhanced Visualizations
- **Correlation Matrices**: RdYlBu color scheme with correlation insights panel
- **Pie Charts**: Crypto-specific color palette (Bitcoin Orange, Ethereum Blue, etc.)
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover details, zoom functionality, responsive design

## Risk Profiles

| Profile | Target Return | Max Volatility | Max Asset Weight |
|---------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Conservative** | 8% | 15% | 30% |
| **Moderate** | 15% | 25% | 40% |
| **Aggressive** | 25% | 40% | 60% |
